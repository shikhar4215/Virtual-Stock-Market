<h1>LEGAL INFORMATION</h1>
<p>
	To open a stock exchange, we need to follow the guidelines provided in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) act, 1956 (SCRA). This act provides the legal procedure to get a stock exchange recognized by the central government.
	First an application has to be submitted to the central government in a prescribed format along with the bye-laws of the exchange and other rules.
	After that the central government may conduct an inspection and if everything is right then they will give the status of “Recognized” to the exchange.
	This application is to be submitted to the SBI/Treasury/RBI along with a fee of Rs.500.
	Thus, this system is legally feasible.
